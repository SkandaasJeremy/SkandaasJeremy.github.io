                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><em><strong>Grooming</strong></em><br>This dog ,as it is a short haired breed so a bath is all you need. The eyes and years should be cleaned using a damp towel carefully. Nails should be kept short.<br><strong><em>Exercise</em></strong><br>Every dogs needs exercise. The only difference is some need a lot some need less!! This is a big dog that can overheat quickly so be careful while exercising him in warm weather. Neo puppies<br>want to play beyond the time he should. so stop him before he gets tired otherwise he might damage his joints.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Training</em></strong><br>Just like every other dog a neo pup&nbsp;needs to be trained not to tare&nbsp;up and swallow your carpet. Most of the adults are clam and like to sleep very much, their puppy are crazily active, cuddly just as other eeny weeny puppies. The dogs have to be trained at a very young age otherwise the dog will be difficult to train when he grows heavy, stubborn, and grows his personality. Neapolitans do not respond well to harsh training, and need an encouraging and rewarding atmosphere. Be patient and consistent.<br><br><strong><em>Feeding<br></em></strong>The Neapolitan Mastiff should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian's supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog's age (puppy, adult, or senior). Experienced Neapolitan Mastiff breeders recommend food that is slightly higher in fat and lower in protein, especially when the dog is young, as they grow so fast. Do not supplement with calcium. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog's weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.<br><br><em><strong>Health</strong></em><br>Neapolitans are generally hardy dogs. One minor problem that often occurs is "cherry eye," where tissue in the corner of the eye becomes red and inflamed. In the vast majority of cases, there is no permanent damage. Despite the breed's impressive wrinkles and loose skin, most do not have skin problems. There are health problems that are common in giant dogs to which the breed is not immune. Bloat is a sudden, life-threatening condition that can affect all deep-chested dogs. Its causes are not fully understood, but owners should learn the signs that bloat is occurring and know what action to take. As with all breeds, the Mastino can also develop hip dysplasia. It is important to discuss any health concerns with the dog's breeder and veterinarian.
<br>
<br>Recommended Health Tests :
<br>Hip Evaluation
<br>Elbow Evaluation
<br>Cardiac Exam
<br>Ophthalmologist Exam<br><br><strong><em>Temperament</em></strong><br>These dogs have a calm temperament&nbsp;but will be&nbsp;aggressive to protect you or your other&nbsp;pets. They are protective ,stubborn, fearless, obedient and also easily trainable(for experienced dog owners (..))&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><em><strong>So now you know how to care for Neapolitan&nbsp;mastiffs, you are going to be a great neo mom/dad. You&nbsp;just have to follow the above given rules and get the tests done .He will live with for about 8-10 years. He is going to love you&nbsp;and even care for you just as much you do to him. But&nbsp;again he might not be suitable&nbsp;dog for you if you have a busy lifestyle&nbsp;or are a first&nbsp;time dog owner. But anyways dogs are the best.</strong></em><br><br><br><em><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enjoy wagging your tails!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong><br></em><br><em><strong><br></strong></em><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>
